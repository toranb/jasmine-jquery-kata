A very simple javascript kata showing jasmine and jquery in action

To run the tests you first need to install phantomJS

Ubuntu `apt-get install phantomjs`
OSX `brew install phantomjs`

Next run npm install to pull down the jasmine-phantom-node module

npm install

Now you can run the tests from the root project directory

node node_modules/jasmine-phantom-node/bin/jasmine-phantom-node ember/static/script/tests

The jasmine spec file can be found ember/static/script/tests/people.spec.js
The production javascript file under test can be found at ember/static/script/app/person.js

Since this app does have a full django backend, you can spin it up like so

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python manage.py syncdb
3. python manage.py runserver
